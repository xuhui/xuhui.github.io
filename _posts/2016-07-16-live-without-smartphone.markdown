## Smartphone free

Recently I am gradually trying to quit my smartphones. Without a mobile phone at my side, I almost have 2 more hours on working, reading everyday.

when I am on the go, I take my Kindle and a GSM phone.

please contact me by writing to mail@zhouxuhui.com or drop me a line with real paper.

and I hope I will have more blogging here. :D
